# Project Creation and Implementation Details Breakdown

https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-i-built-an-ai-to-play-flappy-bird-81b672b66521

# Instructions
Run ***flappy_bird.py*** and watch an AI built - start training itself to play the game of **Flappy Bird**!

# Inputs
NEAT tries to create/delete and construct the best topology, by adjusting the weights and biases for each of the possible paths and their allocated nodes

The following Neural Network, heavily is dependent on the following Input variables:

# Outputs Obtained

A Bird either Jumps or it doesn't

# Activation Function

**TanH Activation Fucntion** is chosen to make it easy to tell wheter a bird did or did not Jump

# Max. Genome Generation
Set to be **30**, as it is a **massive treshhold**, upon reaching which it is **statistically impossible** under the normal Flappy-Bird game mechanics - for the best-performning bird not to adapt to the gameplay and for the latter in the context of a fore-mentioned scenario to exist.
